                            This famous recipe was composed in 1890 by the grand grand father of Alex
                            when he was experimenting an old recipe from his mother. Since then this recipe has become one of the most renowned
                            dish in all Peru. The original recipe is kept improved by each generation!

                            The salad and prawn recipe was proposed for the very first time in 1960 by the oncle of Alex
                            in replacement of former similar recipe which was fish-based. The harmony between the ingredients of this recipe and its simplicity is just astonishing!
                            This salad can be accompanied by different sauce making it a unique and unforgettable must-taste!
